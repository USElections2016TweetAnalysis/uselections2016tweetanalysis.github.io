                        <p>During our project, early on we managed to set up a script to capture the data that we needed. This proved to be a challenging task
                        as there were a lot of limitations on the Twitter API. We think we managed to explore the data we had at hand to great lengths by first generating
                        a wide variety of statistics to better understand and guide our analysis, then building a network on top of that and trying to find information in the network
                        properties. Finally, our analysis focused on untaming the data behind the text of the tweets, by conducting sentiment analysis, seeing which were the top words
                        by countries, etc. </p>

                        <p>We also feel like our analysis didn't manage to really show any important breakthrough or unexpected result, most of them
                        were quite normal, even though we tested different techniques on different type of data, and at different scales.
                        We assume there isn't any real breakthrough to unveil from what we have, we'd probably need more data to be able to come to stronger conclusions.</p>

                        <p>There are many other type of networks we could build, and they might prove to be more interesting to study, such as a network of the followers of each
                        candidate, etc.</p>

                        <p>We would also have liked to address the issue with <b>Twitter bots</b>, even though we didn't experience it
                        at any time during our analysis, we've read many articles on the web talking about how Twitter bots supposedly
                        influenced the outcome of the elections. This is why we would have liked to see for ourselves if, based on the data
                        we have, Twitter bots really accounted a lot during the elections.
