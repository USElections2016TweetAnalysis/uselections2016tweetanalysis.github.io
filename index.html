                        that you and your friends tend to have the same views on many subjects. That's one of the reasons
                        why so many people were shocked about Donald Trump's election, they simply didn't see it coming. </p>

                        Data Overview
                    </h2>
                    <p>The data we are analyzing is a collection of tweets from Twitter retrieved during the period of the elections.
                    For this, we focused on collecting tweets from the week prior to election day to the week after election day.</p>
                    <img id="collection-timeline" src="img/collection_timeline.png" />

                    <p>To retrieve the data, we came up with custom queries to collect tweets related to the elections, by using hashtags and
                    focusing on some countries of the world that seemed relevant to study.</p>

                    <p>In total, after collecting more than <i>4GB</i> of tweets,
                        we extracted <b>90909</b> unique tweets and <b>68359</b> unique users.</p>

                    <p>A first interesting overview of the data is to see how many tweets we collected per hour during the elections:</p>

                    <p>Clearly, and logicially, we can see that apart from the US, the UK is also very active, along with Canada that tweeted a lot of November 9, Australia, India, and South Africa. This is quite logic as those countries speak primarly English or were British colonies. On November 9, South American countries also reacted vividly to the elections, with Brazil and Mexico. In Europe, France and Germany leaded the way, followed by Sweden, and Denmark.</p>

                    <p>If we know look at some countries that we selected to make the plot clearer, we can see that apart from the US, Canada, and the UK, the other countries tweet more or less the same throughout the days during the elections, with the expection of a spike on election day.</p>

                    <p>To finish our overview of data, we'll visualise which countries were the most active during the elections on a world map:</p>

                        <p>With the help of the Twitter API we can build this graph by connecting our user with a direct link to the account they follow ! In the end we have a brand (big!) new graph that has  64728  node and  78788 edges. If we have a look at the biggest accounts in terms of follower (nodes' in degree) we run into famous names such as : wikileaks, BarackObama, realDonaldTrump or HillaryClinton. </p> 
                        <p> But looking at the biggest accounts in term of friend (nodes' out degree) we have less known and average people</p>
                        <p>Now that we have our graph we can have a look at the degree distributions (e.g try to indentify if the degree distributions follow
                        some kind of function):  </p>

                 <p>In Figure 1 we can see that the most common in degree is 2, with more than 50k occurences, but after 6 in degree it seems we have no more nodes. However the out degree distribution is way broader. very few users have the same out degree but it goes from 0 to roughly 5000.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">Figure 3 - Plot of distributions on a log-scale.</span>

                        <p>The in degree distributions seem to approach a power-law as we can see the long tail (Figure 3) at the begining where the number of nodes with low degrees is really high and then it decreases as a power-law (with a few fluctuations that mean we have a few high influential individuals that have a lot of followers).</p>
                        <p>We can see that the in-degrees and out-degrees do not follow the same curve. This means that we can't expect to have as many connections coming in than coming out. And this interpretation makes sense as our network was build from a social media platform : we tend to follow more people than we have followers. On the other hand, the blue curve (and the out degree distributions in general) is pretty chaotic, we can't tell if it follows any particular distribution.</p>

                        <P>The graph is way too big to be drawn, so we decide to make a smaller graph. The idea is to keep the node with a degree greater than 3 only. We have a lot of isolated accounts that are quite useless in this centrality analysis. The new graph had now 2785 nodes and and  12228 edges.</P>

                        <p>As we were exepecting, it seems like we have a few central accounts and thousands of smaller ones gravitating aroung them. To learn more about these central accounts we will now go through some centrality measures. We perform these algorithms on the reduced network as these measures are very costly.
                        Betweeness centrality measures how central a node is. Users with a high betweenness centrality may have a good followers/following ratio. We will look into these accounts later on.</p>

                        <p>... these ones aren't. And once again, that makes sense, famous users will have more followers, but as an average person, you can follow as many people as you want !</p>
                        <h5> Conclusion :</h5>
                        <p>The results we have on centrality measures let us think that we have quite a good network. We have famous people with a lot of followers and Twitter addicts with a lot of "friends". It is also interesting to note that the betweeness centrality and the eigenvector centrality do not provide the exact same results. It will be interesting to see if we come across these names again when dealing with communities (and we'll see who these people actually are !).</p>
                        
                        <h4> Community </h4>
                        <p>To perform community detection we'll use the Louvain algorithm. The inspiration for this method of community detection is the optimization of Modularity as the algorithm progresses. Modularity is one measure between -1 and 1 of the structure of networks. It was designed to measure the strength of division of a network into modules (also called groups, clusters or communities). 
                        Networks with high modularity have dense connections between the nodes within modules but sparse connections between nodes in different modules. (Wikipédia)</p>
                        <p> We got a louvain modularity of 0.4, we can say this modularity is pretty high, which means we have good partitions in our network.</p>

                        <p>We have 7 communities and we can see once more that one group is completely disconnected from the others. That is probably due to the first graph reduction (from 64k nodes to 2k nodes). This accounts had a lot of followers but they weren't popular so they've been removed. Now we have this isolated community while the others are connected.</p>

                        <p>Alright, we have a lot of informations to processe here, so we'll work community by community. Next to account's name we provide the Twitter descriptions and/or a general description.</p>

This community is made of people who claim to be independant, unbiased, left winged and against politicians such as Donald J. Trump. It also seems that these users (the real person behind) are quite educated (PhD, Exec Dir, BUsiness, Bill Gates, Wikileaks...)</p>

                        <p>This community is cleary made of Trump supporters and on a larger scale, republicans. We can see a lot of FOX News TV host, a TV channel which strongly supported Trump during the campain (and still does). We also have different personnality from Trump familly, board, government... When looking at the top accounts by out degree we come accross strongly patriotic users (a lot of Star Spangled Banners and bald eagles on the pages) and Trump supporters. Two things to notice however :</p> Trump isn't in the top account, which is a odd, and we have at least one "troll" account (Trevor90666770) and we may have some more that would probably biase the sentiment</p>

                        <p>This community is now Democrat. We have a senator, Michelle Obama and Chelsea Clinton but democrat journalists such as CNN/Bloomberg reporters. Once again we have to notice that Hillary and Obama aren't in the top accounts (also uncanny)</p>

                        <p>It is really difficult to label this community. We have a lot of different users indeed. From TV host, to average users and even the star wars account... It seems this community is a big melting pot and it will be hard to get any trustworthy result, so we won't spend too much time on this one.</p>
